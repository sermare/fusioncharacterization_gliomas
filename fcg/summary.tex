Final Thoughts
The paper’s current form is weak in fulfilling its stated goal due to the narrative hijack by detection comparisons. By refocusing on FG characterization—using the technical analyses as supporting evidence—and expanding biological insights, it could become a strong contribution to glioma research. The recommended changes prioritize bioinformatics tools to deepen the FG story, ensuring the methods serve the biology rather than dominate it. Implementing these adjustments would require rebalancing the text (e.g., 70% FG characterization, 30% technical validation) and leveraging the rich dataset (Figures 1A, 3, 6, 7) to tell a compelling biological tale.
